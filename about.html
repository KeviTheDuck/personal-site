			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Kinjal Kavish Boro, I'm 16 years old and currently in the last year of high school. I am new to coding. I gathered interest 
		    	in programming and Penetration Testing when I was bored in 2020.I have learned Python, JavaScript, HTML, MarkDown, 
		    	NodeJS and a little bit of CSS. I am not sure what I will do in the field of Computer Science at this time, but I 
		    	know it will be around Cyber Security. And I like Ducks ....why?, idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

		    	<p align="center">I don't use my real name often coz it sounds cringe acording to me. And that's why I use <b>KeviTheDuck</b> as 
		    	   my name on the Internet.And there's the word 'Duck' after Kevi coz I like ducks I guess. I like to spend my time on 
		    	   <a style="color: #7558ad;" href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a> learning about Cyber Security and on 
		    	   my <a style="color: #7558ad;" href="https://discord.gg/P75XhvtPkh">Discord server</a> making bots or chilling with 
		    	   friends.
			    </p>
		    	<br><br>
				<p align="center">
				So here's the backstory of mine. So 2020 started, was bored so started playing games and then slowly started 
		    	feeling bored again. Then I got interested in Coding and learnt Python. then i made some kids programs and games.
		    	<br>In late 2020, I met Michael, Noble and Alex and 
		    	   they were also interested in Game development so we made a small team consisting Nobel, Michael, Shinaki(my school friend), 
		    	   Alex and me and decided to make a 2D game but we cancelled it after a month coz we all had exams.
		    	</p> 
		    	   After that exams began so didn't do any more programming that year.
			</p>

			   <p align="center">In 2021 I started programming again in April. I made a Spammer using Python when I was bored 
			   and wanted to spam in my friend's server. I also made a Mac Address Changer in Python for linux. 
			   I am currently working on a NodeJS discord bot. </p>
